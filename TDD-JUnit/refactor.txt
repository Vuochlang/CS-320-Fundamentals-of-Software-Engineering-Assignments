Refactor after STEP 9:
    In MyStack.java:
        Function 3: push function - "There was only a simple statement to store the parameter in the first index of the
                    array. Then I added more rules and algorithms to store the parameter in the array by using the
                    for-loop function."
        Function 4: pop function - "It was only return the first data in the array and empty the array. Then I added
                    for-loop function to move every data up an index after popped a number."

Refactor after STEP 10:
    In MyStack.java:
        Function 4: pop function - "I added an if statement to throw the EmptyStackException if the array is empty."

Refactor after STEP 14:
    In MyStack.java:
        Function 5: top function - "It was only return the first data in the array. Then I added another if statement to
                    throw an EmptyStackException if the array is empty by checking the value of item_store."

Refactor after STEP 15:
    In MyStack.java:
        Function 3: push function - "I added another if statement to throw the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if the
                    stack is full"
